### Background

The current global energy structure is transforming from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy. At present, one-third of the world's power generation comes from renewable energy, and wind energy is the main driving force for the transformation of renewable energy. In recent years, wind power generation has grown rapidly, with an average annual growth rate of 10% and accounting for about 24% of renewable energy. All wind turbines installed by the end of 2018 can cover nearly 6% of global electricity demand. It is expected that there will be more wind energy growth in the next few years.

Accurate wind energy forecasting is essential for smart grid operation. This projects studies machine learning algorithms for short-term wind power generation prediction.
